  "schema:description": "This album, with approximately 225 black and white photographs, follows the lives of newly-weds Marian and Jerry who travel throughout California and the Southwest visiting their families, national parks and other scenic places. Locations in California include Monterey coast, Santa Cruz, San Simeon, Buck's Lake, Marin County, San Francisco, Mt. Lassen, and Lake Tahoe. They visited Muir Woods, took a boat trip to the 1939 San Francisco World's Fair, honeymooned along the Oregon coast and Olympic Peninsula in Washington, and went skiing at Badger Pass in Yosemite National Park. The couple seems to have gone a big trip each year. In 1940 they traveled to Colorado; visited Craig, Central City, Steamboat Springs, Rocky Mountain National Park, Red Rocks, Garden of the Gods, Colorado Springs, Mesa Verde National Park and Royal Gorge. They also explored the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park, Dinosaur National Monument and Salt Lake City, Utah. There are many fun candid shots of the couple playing tourist and many family group shots as well.",
